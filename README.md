# Scraps

Scraps lets you quickly save names or terms you wish to google later. I often hear book titles, film titles, artist names, etc and want to remember them so I can google them later. This little app lets you do that quickly. It's very simple :)

It currently takes advantage of the Dropbox [Datastore API](http://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore) so you'll need a Dropbox account to use it. If you want to tinker, start a new [Dropbox Datastore App](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/app_info/) and plug the App Key and App Secret into the macros in the AppDelegate.m file. Build the app using iOS7, authenticate and you should be up and running.
