/** A record represents an entry in a particular table and datastore. A record has a unique ID, and
 contains a set of fields, each of which has a name and a value. You can get records from a
 <DBTable> object.
 <p>
 Values you set to the following types: NSString, NSNumber, NSDate, NSData, NSArray. For objects of
 type NSNumber, the value of <code>objCType</code> is not guaranteed to be preserved. When you get
 a field that has a list value, its type will be DBList, which allows you to perform conflict-free
 list mutations.  Note that records do not have null fields - only fields which are unset.
 </p><p>
 Changes to this record are immediately visible to other record objects with the same
 <code>tableId</code> and <code>recordId</code> Calling <code>-[DBDatastore sync:]</code>, which
 incorporates remote changes into your datastore, will also update any records you have a
 reference to. </p> */
