/** A datastore is a simple, syncable database for app data. You can open the default datastore
 using <openDefaultStoreForAccount:error:> and open or create other datastores using a
 <DBDatastoreManager>.
 
 You interact with data in the datastore using tables. You can call <getTable:> to get a table,
 or <getTables:> to list all tables in a datastore containing records.

 Changes you make to the datastore will be visible immediately, and calling <sync:> will persist
 outgoing changes and queue them to be uploaded to the server. While a datastore is open, it will
 monitor for remote changes and download them when possible. When there are remote changes waiting
 to be incorporated, the `DBDatastoreIncoming` flag will be set in the <status> bitset, and calling
 <sync:> will also apply those changes to your view of the datastore, resolving any conflicts along
 the way.
 
 To find out when there are changes ready to be synced, add an observer using <addObserver:block:>
 to register a block that will be called every time <status> changes.
